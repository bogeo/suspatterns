Formal Descriptions of Sustainable Software Design Patterns

## Project description
Use and operation of software has significant effects on environment and society. Despite this, design and implementation of green and sustainable software turn out to be difficult tasks. Practical guidelines and hints to assist software architects and programmers in their everyday-business are still rare. The question arises whether there are reusable solutions or solution components in the form of so-called "design patterns" leading to sustainable software implementations. 

This experimental GitHub repository contains a collection of sustainable software design pattern descriptions. We tried to describe the patterns formally. By now, algebraic specification techniques have been used. Of course, other approaches might be suitable and considered in the future.    

From a technical point of view, formal pattern descriptions are embedded into an XML-based overarching pattern language here, namely the "pattern language modelling language (PLML). 

Notwithstanding, in order to support software developers, there is the demand to continue the search for more applicable design patterns (“pattern mining”) and to set up a design knowledge repository comprising of pattern collections. You would be very welcome to join our activities!

### CafeOBJ
To run the pattern descriptions given in CafeOBJ syntax (recognizable by the language attribute inside the PLML-based descriptions: <formalization language="CafeOBJ" ...>), you have to install CafeOBJ on your computer, which is freely available [here](https://cafeobj.org/).
