	<problem>
		A new software or the update release of an already installed software does 
		not run on the computer which is currently in use.
	</problem>
	<solution>
		The software producer ensures that the new software release runs on the 
		old machine. Since ICT permanently undergoes evelutionary developments,  
		it will be hard to ensure this. However, a recommendation could be as 
		follows: The software producer guarantees that the current release runs
		in a reference system that is not older than 5 years [2, 3].
	</solution>

			However, this gives more a postulation than a software design 
			pattern. Maybe in the future we can identify some concrete patterns
			which allow to achieve this goal. Some clues could be provided by a 
			formal description (what still is a ToDo; however, the system to be 
			described formally could include product stakeholders such as the 
			user or product managers as well as the machine which might become 
			obsolescent or system-internal interfaces as participants).
