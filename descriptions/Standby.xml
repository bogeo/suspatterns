	<problem>
		The computer supplying software components consumes electric energy 
		although no software is in use.
	</problem>
	<solution>
		Let the computer enter a sleep state, i.e. pause the state of the 
		machine. When restored, the operation continues from the same point,
		offering the same applications, having the same files open, being in
		exactly in the same state as when paused. 
	</solution>
	<evidence>
		<rationale>
			Basically, there will be some controversy as to whether this is a 
			sustainability pattern or whether just energy efficiency is 
			increased. However, implementation of this "pattern" might raise
			sustainability awareness (see related pattern).
