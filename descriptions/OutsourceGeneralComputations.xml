	<problem>
		A recurring, computationally intensive task (for example the evening analysis of all sales 
		results of a supermarket chain) increases the hardware requirements for the overall system 
		in which it is performed. If the system is otherwise not very computationally intensive, there 
		will be an avoidable energy loss since the hardware is geared towards this edge-case. [1]
	</problem>
	<solution>
		Release such a task into its own (e.g. containerized) environment that will be available 
		at execution time of the task only. This can save a large amount of energy. The actual system 
		and thus the hardware to be operated continuously becomes smaller and more efficient.
	</solution>
