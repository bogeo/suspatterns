	<problem>
		Since most modern software systems usually intensively make use of 
		third-party components, it is difficult to provide systems which are
		not built from insustainable parts.
	</problem>
	<solution>
		One approach would be to provide information about the used parts,
		e.g. in the form of "information leaflets", and to assist the software 
		developer when part selection decisions have to be made. 
	</solution>
